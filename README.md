### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Penny, currently working as a front-end developer. 

Previously, as jurnalist, marketer, and community builder for over 7 years, I have worked with engineers and managed cross-border projects in France, Singapore, and the US. 

I am able to connect with various stakeholders on projects and enjoy problem-solving through storytelling, in the programming language, and multiple languages (CN/EN/JP).
